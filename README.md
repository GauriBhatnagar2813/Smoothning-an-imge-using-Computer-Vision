In many image processing pipelines, we must blur an image to reduce high-frequency noise, making it easier for our algorithms to detect and understand the actual contents of the image rather than just noise that will “confuse” our algorithms. Blurring an image is very easy in OpenCV and there are a number of ways to accomplish it.
